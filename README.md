# Cartoonifying an Image
Image cartoonization helps in transforming real world photos into cartoon images. Cartoons are an essential part of everyone's childhood.To Cartoonize an image firstly an input image is loaded,it begins with loading the input image using a readfile function. Next, an edge mask is created to highlight the edges within the image. Subsequently, the color palette is reduced using the K-means clustering algorithm. To refine the color transitions and remove noise, a bilateral filter is applied. Finally, the edge mask is combined with the color quantized image using the bitwise and function, merging the outlined edges with the reduced color palette, resulting in a cartoon-like effect that enhances the image visual. Thus transforms the original image to a Cartoon image.
